# SparseR
Implement sparse representation based classification approach on differents datasets

## Method
This is a simple implementation of Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) from this famous article: 
#### Wright, J., Yang, A. Y., Ganesh, A., Sastry, S. S., & Ma, Y. (2008). Robust face recognition via sparse representation. IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 31(2), 210-227.

## Dataset
To simplify our work, we use two simple datasets from Kaggle.
#### Villains - Image Classification: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rogeriovaz/villains-image-classification
#### WineDataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davorbudimir/winedataset
